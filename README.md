# Duct

[Duct](http://github.com/petrh/duct) is clone of [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/) in Dart
which aims to be protocol-level compatible with the original implementation.

## Contributing

Duct is at still at the early stage of development and all contribution
are more than welcome. Fork Duct on GitHub, make it awesomer and send a
pull request when it is ready.

Please note that one of the Duct's design goals is to use as many Dart
idioms as possible while retaining the Socket.IO compatibility.
